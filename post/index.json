                "body": " Use image Create Image  Important commands:\ndocker pull image-name docker run local-name image-name docker ps docker build Use image Some basic commands to start using Docker. Two things are important ie. Docker Image and Docker Container. To fetch RStudio image from Docker Hub run the command:\ndocker pull rocker/rstudio When the image has been pulled to the local Docker engine, you could use the image with\ndocker run --rm rocker/rstudio Here the option --rm is used to tell docker to delete the image when stopping. Running docker run is actually a short command to docker create and docker start. Other options that often are used when using docker run command include:\n -d to detach the terminal to keep container running. -P (capital P) to publish all exposed ports to random ports -p to expose specific port only --name to give a name we want for the container  To expose port 8787 both for server inside the container and externally of image rocker/rstudio\ndocker run -p 8787:8787 --name rstudio rocker/rtudio To access RStudio from the webbrowser run http://localhost:8787\nTo check all pulled images in the local machine, run docker images command. It is wise to delete images that aren\u0026rsquo;t used to reduce space. Deleting the images is done using docker rmi image-name command.\nTo list all containers, use either of these commands.\ndocker container ls -a docker ps -a The options -a will also list the containers with existed status. To delete all containers that are already existed, use the command docker container prune. Else, ordinary bash method defining all the options with\ndocker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=existed) Without defining the specific options will only remove a certain container ie. docker rm rstudio. The option -q for just returning the numeric ID and -f for filtering output based on conditions provided.\nUse docker stop to end container and docker restart to restart it.\nCreate Image When no available image suits your need, than you can create one using Dockerfile which is a text file consists of commands that Docker client will call while creating an image. Example of Dockerfile copied from tutorial.\nFROM python:3 # set a directory for the app WORKDIR /usr/src/app # copy all the files to the container COPY . . # install dependencies RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt # define the port number the container should expose EXPOSE 5000 # run the command CMD [\u0026#34;python\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./app.py\u0026#34;] Then run docker build command from terminal as follows:\ndocker build -t yourusername/catnip . The option -t takes an optional tag name and a location of the directory containing the Dockerfile. Yourusername is the username from your Docker Hub account. When you will run the completed image, then run:\ndocker run -p 8888:5000 yourusername/catnip The command we just ran used port 5000 for the server inside the container and exposed this externally on port 8888. Head over to the URL with port 8888 with https://localhost:8888/\n"

Cara seperti diatas,\ngit submodule foreach git checkout master git submodule foreach git pull origin master Atau buat pull request dengan cara:\ncd public git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/37f62cf Nombor 37f62cf ialah contoh rujukan HEAD semasa dari GitHub commit.\nCoba tukar branch ke master.\ngit checkout master Kekunci ssh Sekiranya ingin pakai kekunci ssh boleh tukar di file config di:\n .git/config  [submodule \u0026#34;public\u0026#34;] # url = https://github.com/yusbk/yusbk.github.io.git url = git@personal:yusbk/yusbk.github.io.git  .git/module/public/config  [remote \u0026#34;origin\u0026#34;] # url = https://github.com/yusbk/yusbk.github.io.git url = git@personal:yusbk/yusbk.github.io.git fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* "

Untuk menukarkan kode penggunaan ifelse adalah cara yang senang dipakai. Akan tetapi penggunaannya di base R memakai masa yang panjang terutama sekirannya melarikan di data yang besar. Ini kerana penggunaan ifelse di base terlebih dahulu menyusun data sebelum membuat pilihan.\nCara yang diterangkan disini ialah untuk pemakaian ifelse di data.table dan cara-cara lain yang diperkenalkan di pakej dplyr atau pakej yang lainnya.\nCara data.table Cara yang biasa di data.table ialah menggunakan teknik DT[i,j,by]. Contoh lain bila ingin menukarkan var2 kepada angka 2 sekiranya var1 ialah ja.\nDT[var1 == \u0026#34;ja\u0026#34;, var2 := 2] Contoh di bawah menggunakan cara piping dengan magrittr.\nispDT[, ispad2 := 0] %\u0026gt;% .[alder \u0026gt;= 10 \u0026amp; diagVar \u0026gt;= 2, ispad2 := 1] %\u0026gt;% .[alder \u0026lt; 10 \u0026amp; diagVar \u0026gt;= 5, ispad2 := 1] Sekiranya ingin menukarkan pelbagai nilai di var1 contohnya ja = 1 dan nei = 2 di var2 boleh juga dibuat seperti cara begini menggunakan prinsip di SQL:\nDT[.(var1 = c(\u0026#34;ja\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nei\u0026#34;), to = 1:2), on = \u0026#34;var1\u0026#34;, var2 := i.to] Pengunaan set juga disarankan untuk mempercepatkan proses di data.table sekiranya ingin memakai loop. Contoh bila ingin menukarkan semua kolom yang menggandungi angka 3 atau 5 kepada nilai NA boleh dibuat seperti begini:\nfor(j in seq_along(DT)) { set(DT, i=which(DT[[j]] %in% c(3,5)), j=j, value=NA) } Cara yang lebih advance boleh dibaca di Stack Overflow. Ringkasan penerangan cara ini:\nWe specify the \u0026lsquo;selectedcols\u0026rsquo; in .SDcols, grouped by sequence of rows, we unlist the Subset of Data.table (unlist(.SD)), get the index of the first non-NA value (\u0026lsquo;j1\u0026rsquo;), use that to get the \u0026lsquo;v1\u0026rsquo; corresponding to the index and the column names, assign (:=) to create two new columns.\nAim is to get the best value for each row which is the value of the first non-NA column in the given order of selected columns.\nlibrary(data.table) library(magrittr) n \u0026lt;- 7 set.seed(1234) dt \u0026lt;- sample.int(100, n*5, replace = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% ifelse(. \u0026lt; 35, NA, .) %\u0026gt;% matrix(, nrow = n) %\u0026gt;% as.data.table() selected_cols \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#34;V3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;V4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;V1\u0026#34;) dt[, c(\u0026#34;best_val\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;best_col\u0026#34;) := {v1 \u0026lt;- unlist(.SD) j1 \u0026lt;- which(!is.na(v1))[1] list(v1[j1], names(.SD)[j1]) }, .SDcols = selected_cols, by = 1:nrow(dt)] dt # V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 best_val best_col #1: NA NA NA NA 84 NA NA #2: 63 67 84 NA NA 84 V3 #3: 61 52 NA NA 46 61 V1 #4: 63 70 NA NA NA 63 V1 #5: 87 55 NA 82 NA 82 V4 #6: 65 NA NA 53 51 53 V4 #7: NA 93 NA 92 NA 92 V4 Cara dplyr Menggunakan fungsi ifelse dimana ianya lebih cepat dari base R ifelse.

Disini saya terangkan caranya di Linux dan Windows.\nLinux Bila pasang program di Linux melalui source boleh tetapkan dimana program disimpan melalui penetapkan --prefix bila melarikan ./configure. Cara biasa bila pasang program dari source ialah:\n./configure make make install Bila ./configure tidak menetapkan prefix secara tidak langsung komando yang dipakai ialah ./configure --prefix=/usr/local dimana folder /usr/local dipakai untuk menyimpan fail-fail berkaitan program yang dipasang. Biasanya fail untuk larikan program akan disimpan seterusnya di folder bin, libraries di folder lib, manual di folder man dan seterusnya.\nUntuk tetapkan folder semasa memasng program dari source boleh buat begini:\n./configure --prefix=$HOME/local # atau ./configure --prefix=/home/ybk Bila menetapkan prefix selain dari /usr/local seperti di atas, perlu tetapkan folder tersebut di $PATH agar Linux dapat melarikan program yang ingin dipakai. Untuk periksa folder-folder yang sudah ditetapkan boleh pakai:\n\u0026gt; echo $PATH /home/ybk/.local/bin:/home/ybk/bin:/home/ybk/.local/bin:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/usr/local/stata Penetapan folder di $PATH boleh dibuat dengan cara di bawah. Cara ini akan memasukkan PATH di fail /.profile atau /.bashrc.\n\u0026gt; export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/path/folder\u0026#34; Bila melarikan komando export penetapan di $PATH hanya sementara dan hilang bila mematikan komputer. Untuk memasukan folder yang ditetapkan di --prefix ke $PATH selama-lamanya, harus larikan:\nsource ~/.profile # atau source ~/.bashrc Sekiranya tidak menetapkan di $PATH boleh juga menggunakan symlink\nsudo ln -s /path/ke/folder/baru/ ~/bin Windows Cara daftarkan PATH untuk .exe program bergantung samada kita memiliki administrator right atau tidak. Cara yang ditunjukkan disini ialah disituasi tanpa admin right.\nKita boleh lihat semua program-program yang didaftarkan di PATH dengan melarikan arahan di bawah di power shell atau terminal:\necho %PATH% Sekiranya tidak pasti bagimana untuk membuka terminal, tulis di search samada cmd atau powershell.\nKemudian buka control panel [kontrolpanel] \u0026gt; user [brukerkontoer] \u0026gt; environment\rvariable [miljøvariablene]\nWindow baru akan dibuka dan pilih Variable \u0026gt; Path \u0026gt; edit \u0026gt; new.\nMasukkan path program yang menggandungi .exe.

Disini akan diterangkan cara pemakaian fungsi unique dan duplicated.\nUnik Untuk mendapatkan barisan yang unik di dataset atau unik di kolom tertentu sahaja boleh menggunakan fungsi unique atau !duplicated. Tunjukajar ini akan menggunakan data contoh di bawah:\nlibrary(data.table)\rdat \u0026lt;- data.table(a = c(12, 15,16, rep(11:12, 2),15, rep(12,3), 17, 17, 18),\rb = c(\u0026quot;h\u0026quot;,NA,letters[1:8],\u0026quot;e\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;s\u0026quot;, rep(\u0026quot;q\u0026quot;,2)))\r\u0026gt; dat\ra b\r1: 12 h\r2: 15 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt;\r3: 16 a\r4: 11 b\r5: 12 c\r6: 11 d\r7: 12 e\r8: 15 f\r9: 12 g\r10: 12 h\r11: 12 e\r12: 17 s\r13: 17 q\r14: 18 q\r Barisan ke 10 12 h dan 11 12 e berpendua.\nFungsi unique di data.table akan memilih barisan-barisan yang unik sahaja. Sekiranya ingin menyusun mengikut abjad atau nombor, boleh tetapkan setkey(). Fungi uniqueN() memberikan jumlah barisan yang unik.\n\u0026gt; setkey(dat, a)\r\u0026gt; unique(dat)\ra b\r1: 11 b\r2: 11 d\r3: 12 h\r4: 12 c\r5: 12 e\r6: 12 g\r7: 15 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt;\r8: 15 f\r9: 16 a\r10: 17 s\r11: 17 q\r12: 18 q\r\u0026gt; uniqueN(dat)\r[1] 12\r Data hanya tinggal 12 barisan sahaja sebab 12 h di barisan 10 dan 12 e di barisan 11 berpendua dan penduaanya dikeluarkan. Hanya barisan 3 dan 5 sahaja yang disimpan.\nUntuk memilih barisan berdasarkan nilai unik di kolom tertentu, boleh menggunakan fungsi !duplicated. Penggunaan unique akan hanya memberikan nilai-nilai unik sebagai vektor. Akan tetapi penggunaan unique cara data.table memberikan nilai yang tidak diingini kerana unique tidak dipakai bila menggunakan pendekatan awam data.table iaitu DT[i,j,by]. Ia hanya dipakai menggunakan expression cara unique().\n\u0026gt; unique(dat$a)\r[1] 11 12 15 16 17 18\r\u0026gt; dat[!duplicated(a)]\ra b\r1: 11 b\r2: 12 h\r3: 15 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt;\r4: 16 a\r5: 17 s\r6: 18 q\r\u0026gt; dat[unique(a)]\ra b\r1: 16 a\r2: 17 s\r3: NA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt;\r4: NA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt;\r5: NA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt;\r6: NA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt;\r Duplikasi Untuk mencari duplikasi boleh menggunakan fungsi duplicated atau unique yang terdapat di base. Kedua-duanya akan memberikan vektor. Fungsi duplicated akan memberikan TRUE FALSE manakala unique memberikan data pendua.\nData.table juga menggunakan duplicated atau unique untuk mendapatkan duplikasi. Untuk mengenalpasti semua data yang ada penduanya bolehlah membuat kolom baru yang menetapkan barisan yang berpendua:\n\u0026gt; dat[, fD := .N \u0026gt; 1, by = dat]\r\u0026gt; dat\ra b fD\r1: 12 h TRUE\r2: 15 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; FALSE\r3: 16 a FALSE\r4: 11 b FALSE\r5: 12 c FALSE\r6: 11 d FALSE\r7: 12 e TRUE\r8: 15 f FALSE\r9: 12 g FALSE\r10: 12 h TRUE\r11: 12 e TRUE\r12: 17 s FALSE\r13: 17 q FALSE\r14: 18 q FALSE\r Untuk melihat kolom tertentu yang berpendua boleh dibuat seperti cara dibawah dimana kolom a dipilih dan semua yang berpendua di kolom tersebut dibariskan:\ndat[duplicated(a)|duplicated(a, fromLast = TRUE), list(dd=sort(a))] dd 1: 11 2: 11 3: 12 4: 12 5: 12 6: 12 7: 12 8: 12 9: 15 10: 15 11: 17 12: 17 Penggunaan fromLast=TRUE ialah untuk mendapatkan barisan terakhir yang berpendua. Sekiranya hanya memakai fromLast=TRUE barisan berpendua yang pertama tidak dikira.\nKekunci Sekiranya ingin membuang semua yang berpendua berasaskan kekunci boleh dibuat seperti contoh dibawah. Contoh ini diambil dari StackOverflow. Cara ini hanya akan berfungsi selepas menetapkan kekunci di data.table dengan setkey atau setkeyv.\nlibrary(data.table) myDT \u0026lt;- fread( \u0026#34;id,fB,fC 1, b1,c1 2, b2,c2 3, b1,c1 4, b3,c3 5, b1,c1 \u0026#34;) ## Tetapkan kekunci setkeyv(myDT, c(\u0026#39;fB\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;fC\u0026#39;)) Untuk dapatkan barisan berpendua berasaskan kekunci fB dan fC.\ndups = duplicated(myDT, by = key(myDT)); myDT[, fD := dups | c(tail(dups, -1), FALSE)] #shift dups to 1 position ie. -1 ## Cara lama dan agak lambat myDT[, fD := .N \u0026gt; 1, by=key(myDT)] ## hasilnya myDT id fB fC fD 1: 1 b1 c1 TRUE 2: 3 b1 c1 TRUE 3: 5 b1 c1 TRUE 4: 2 b2 c2 FALSE 5: 4 b3 c3 FALSE Indeks barisan Kadang-kadang kita hanya ingin dapatkan indeks barisan yang berpendua tanpa perlu mendapatkan data. Cara ini memerlukan fungi which. Contohnya:\n\u0026gt; which(duplicated(dat)) [1] 10 11 Untuk menggunakan pendekatan cara data.table adalah seperti dibawah. Cara pertama dan kedua hanya memberikan index barisan terakhir atau pertama yang berpendua manakala cara ketiga memberikan semua barisan yang berpendua.\n\u0026gt; dat[duplicated(dat), which=TRUE]\r[1] 10 11\r## Penggunaan fromLast\r\u0026gt; dat[duplicated(dat, fromLast=TRUE), which=TRUE]\r[1] 1 7\r## Atau utk dapatkan semua barisan yang berpendua\r\u0026gt; dat[duplicated(dat)|duplicated(dat, fromLast=TRUE), which=TRUE]\r[1] 1 7 10 11\r "

Fungsi viewport() digunakan untuk tujuan ini. Contohnya:\nlibrary(grid) vp1 \u0026lt;- viewport(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0.4, just = c(\u0026#34;left\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bottom\u0026#34;), name = \u0026#34;vp1\u0026#34;) grid.show.viewport(vp1)   Figure 1: Grid view\n  Operasi ini bermaksud viewport diletakkan di tengah-tengah mukasurat melalui koordinasi x = 0.5 dan y = 0.5. Unit yang dipakai ialah npc atau \u0026ldquo;Normalised Parent Coordinates\u0026rdquo; yang menggunakan lokasi kiri bawah (0,0) dan kanan atas (1,1). Lebar dan tinggi juga ditetapkan dengan unit yang sama. Sekiranya ingin menukar unit boleh menggunakan cara unit(2, \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;). Penggunaan just untuk menetapkan dimana koordinasi viewport sebelum meletakkan grob.

Table untuk informasi juga akan dibuat menggunakan ggplot2 yang kemudiannya digabungkan menggunakan pakej gridExtra.\nUntuk memastikan plot dan table akan sejajar, adalah penting untuk menggunakan skala yang sama. Skala ini boleh menggunakan nombor atau kumpulan (category). Bila menggunakan skala secara category adalah penting untuk menukarkan status kolom ke factor.\nContoh data:\nlibrary(data.table) library(ggplot2) navn \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#34;Nama1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Nama2 yang panjang\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Nama3\u0026#34;) N \u0026lt;- c(112, 210, 150) N2 \u0026lt;- c(200, 250, 170) dat \u0026lt;- data.table(navn, N, N2) Untuk memastikan kedua-dua plot akan menggunakan skala yang sama, kita boleh buat dummy untuk rujukkan skala.

N or Total xref \u0026lt;- data.table(ref = xrow + 1) #locate at the end of the rows dt \u0026lt;- rbindlist(list(dat, xref), fill = TRUE) #bind to the end rows Untuk mengelakkan NA akan dimasukkan diplot, maka kita perlu kosongkan NA.

Guna heights utk menyeragamkan aksis y manakala weights untuk menyeragamkan aksis x. Contohnya unit.pmax(pp1$weights)\npp1 \u0026lt;- ggplotGrob(plotMain) pp2 \u0026lt;- ggplotGrob(plotText) maxHeight = unit.pmax(pp1$heights, pp2$heights) pp1$heights \u0026lt;- maxHeight pp2$heights \u0026lt;- maxHeight grid.arrange(pp1, pp2, ncol = 2, widths = unit(c(0.8, 0.2), \u0026#34;npc\u0026#34;)) ggplot2::ggsave(\u0026#34;plottable1.svg\u0026#34;) Selain cara ini, boleh juga menggunakan fungsi plot_grid dari pakej Cowplot dan menggunakan align = \u0026quot;h\u0026quot; untuk horizontal (sama y-aksis)\nlibrary(cowplot) cplot \u0026lt;- plot_grid(plotMain, plotText, nrow = 1, align = \u0026#34;h\u0026#34;, rel_widths = c(4, 1)) cowplot::save_plot(\u0026#34;cowplot.svg\u0026#34;, cplot, ncol = 2, base_aspect_ratio = 1.3) cowplot::ggsave(\u0026#34;cowplot2.svg\u0026#34;, cplot) Hasilnya ialah seperti ini:\n"

Tetapi sekiranya nama pada data.table yang ingin digabungkan tidak sama, maka pilihan all=TRUE harus dipakai supaya semua variable dimasukkan tidak kira ianya terdapat hanya di salah satu data.table atau semuanya. Untuk membolehkan all=TRUE option boleh dibuat secara pemakaian function:\nReduce(function(...) merge(..., all = TRUE), list(DT1, DT2, DT3, DT4)) Cara lain boleh juga membuat function diluar Reduce. Seperti begini:\nmymerge = function(x, y) merge.data.table(x, y, all = TRUE) Reduce(mymerge, list(DT1, DT2, DT3, DT4)) ## bila tidak ada key function(x, y) x[y, on = \u0026#34;nama_kolom\u0026#34;] Nama object di global Sekiranya ingin mendapatkan nama-nama object yang ingin digabungkan di global environment, boleh menggunakan fungsi mget.

                "body": " .N Mult .SD dan .SDcols .I .GRP dan rleid Contoh dari manual  Hari ni bersempena Hari kemerdekaan Malaysia ada masa untuk ulang kaji pakej data.table. Hari ni ialah mengenai Special Symbol seperti .N, .I, .GRP, .BY. Penerangan ini diambil dari manual di data.table tetapi diedit sedikit. Untuk rujukan di sini.\nIni data yang dipakai untuk membuat contoh:\nDT = data.table(x=rep(c(\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;c\u0026#34;),each=3), v=c(1,1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2), y=c(1,6,3,7,8), a=1:9, b=9:1) X = data.table(x=c(\u0026#34;c\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;), v=8:7, foo=c(4,2)) .N Penggunaan .N selain dari untuk mendapatkan jumlah baris di dataset, .N boleh juga digunakan untuk melihat barisan terakhir di dataset. Untuk melihat barisan pertama guna DT[1].\nDT[.N] # last row, only special symbol allowed in \u0026#39;i\u0026#39; - nesten som Total DT[, .N] # total number of rows in DT DT[, .N, by=x] # number of rows in each group Mult Contoh untuk penggunaan mult (multiple rows) adalah seperti di bawah. Penggunaan fungsi mult ialah untuk menetapkan kombinasi barisan yang ingin ditunjukkan samada \u0026ldquo;all\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;first\u0026rdquo; atau \u0026ldquo;last\u0026rdquo;. Variable x dan y boleh disusun dengan menggunakan setkey(DT, x, y). Sekiranya tidak disusun terlebih dahulu sebelum dipakai maka harus menggunakan fungsi on seperti contoh di bawah.\n## contoh data dt \u0026lt;- data.table(x = c(1, 1, 3, 1, 7), y = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 6)) setkey(dt, x) ## dapatkan kombinasi yang unik udt \u0026lt;- unique(dt) ## buat kolom dengan nilai 0 dt[, c(\u0026#34;first\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;last\u0026#34;) := 0L][] x y first last 1: 1 1 0 0 2: 1 2 0 0 3: 1 2 0 0 4: 3 3 0 0 5: 7 6 0 0 Menggunakan mult untuk menetapkan kombinasi unik yang diingini. Pemakaian \u0026quot;first\u0026quot; menunjukkan kombinasi pertama sahaja. Sekiranya kombinasi yang sama terdapat dipelbagai baris, hanya barisan yang pertama dimana kombinasi tersebut ditemui akan dipilih. Pemakaian \u0026quot;last\u0026quot; memilih barisan terakhir dimana kombinasi yang diingini ditemui.\n## Sekiranya kombinasi x,y yang pertama terdapat ## di data masukkan 1 di kolom \u0026#34;first\u0026#34; dt[udt, first := 1L, on = c(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;), mult = \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;][] ## Sekiranya kombinasi x,y yang terakhir terdapat ## di data masukkan nilai 1 di kolom \u0026#34;last\u0026#34; dt[udt, last := 1L, on = c(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;), mult = \u0026#34;last\u0026#34;][] x y first last 1: 1 1 1 1 2: 1 2 1 0 3: 3 3 1 1 4: 1 2 0 1 5: 7 6 1 1 Contoh di bawah menunjukkan cara sekiranya hanya ingin mendapatkan index kombinasi yang diingini sahaja.\n## Untuk lihat indeks bagi kombinasi yang unik sahaja dt[unique(dt), on = c(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;), mult = \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;, which = TRUE] [1] 1 2 3 5 Contoh lain menggunakan mult. Seperti kajian isi rumah (household) dimana \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; mewakili rumah. Semua ahli keluarga mempunyai id-rumah sama. Sekiranya ingin mencari ahli termuda atau tertua fungsi mult dapat memudahkan proses.\nset.seed(1234) dt \u0026lt;- data.table(id = sample(1:4, 10, TRUE), umur = sample(20:35, 10, TRUE), jentina = sample(1:2, 10, TRUE), kode = sample(1:5, 2, TRUE)) ## Susun umur mengikut id setkey(dt, id, umur) ## first ialah id yang sama ahli yang paling muda dt[unique(dt), muda := 1L, on = list(id), mult = \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;][] ## Pilih yang terakhir dari id yang sama - cth utk pilih ahli tertua ## sekiranya tidak pakai list di \u0026#39;on = list(nama-var)\u0026#39; boleh pakai \u0026#34;nama-var\u0026#34;. dt[unique(dt), tua := as.integer(1L), on = \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;, mult = \u0026#34;last\u0026#34;, by = .(umur)][] ## pilih nilai pertama untuk setiap kombinasi unik antara \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; dan \u0026#39;kode\u0026#39; dt[unique(dt[, c(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kode\u0026#34;)]), KodePertama := 1L, on = list(id, kode), mult = \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;][] ## pilih nilai terakhir untuk setiap kombinasi unik antara \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; dan \u0026#39;kode\u0026#39; dt[unique(dt[, c(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kode\u0026#34;)]), KodeAkhir := 1L, on = c(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kode\u0026#34;), mult = \u0026#34;last\u0026#34;][] Hasilnya dari contoh pemilihan ahli yang paling muda dan tua dari data di atas menggunakan \u0026quot;first\u0026quot; dan \u0026quot;last\u0026quot;. Pemakaian unique(dt) berasaskan dari penetapan yang dibuat di fungsi setkey dimana data disusun mengikut id kemudian umur terlebih dahulu.\nSekiranya pemilihan kombinasi unik berasaskan kolom lain, selain dari id dan umur yang telah ditetapkan, pemilihan kolom unik boleh dibuat secara fungsi asas menggunakan unique(dt[, c(\u0026quot;kol1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;kol2\u0026quot;)]). Penggunaan on boleh memakai cara list atau concatenate.\nid umur jentina kode muda tua KodePertama KodeAkhir 1: 1 24 2 3 1 NA 1 NA 2: 1 24 2 2 NA NA 1 1 3: 1 31 1 3 NA 1 NA 1 4: 3 22 2 3 1 NA 1 NA 5: 3 23 1 2 NA NA 1 NA 6: 3 24 1 3 NA NA NA 1 7: 3 28 1 2 NA NA NA NA 8: 3 33 2 2 NA NA NA NA 9: 3 34 1 2 NA 1 NA 1 10: 4 24 1 3 1 1 1 1 .SD dan .SDcols Penggunaan .SD juga boleh berasaskan indeks barisan. Contoh untuk menggunakan .SDcols seperti di bawah termasuk menggunakan fungsi lapply. Tetapi penggunaan \u0026quot;.SD\u0026quot; adalah lebih lambat berbanding menggunakan fungsi \u0026quot;on\u0026quot; seperti di atas.\n# pilih kolom \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; dan \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; DT[, .SD, .SDcols = x:y] # baris pertama di semua kolom DT[, .SD[1]] # baris pertama di \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; dan \u0026#39;v\u0026#39; untuk setiap kumpulan di \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; DT[, .SD[1], by = x] # get rows *and* sum all col DT[, c(.N, lapply(.SD, sum)), by = x] # get rows *and* sum columns \u0026#39;v\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; by group DT[, c(.N, lapply(.SD, sum)), by = x, .SDcol = c(\u0026#34;v\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;)] .I Untuk dapatkan indeks barisan simbol .I boleh dipakai. Hanya vektor untuk indeks barisan yang akan diberikan dan tidak nilai di indeks tersebut. Fungsinya sama seperti seq_len(nrow(x)). Semasa penggumpulan dibuat, pada masa yang sama penggumpulan dilakukan di dalam kumpulan yang ditetapkan. Sesuai digunakan untuk membuat subset di j seperti: DT[,.I[which.max(somecol)], by=grp]. Penggunaannya same seperti fungsi which di base.\nCara lain boleh digunakan untuk membuat indentity atau ID. DT[, id := .I] seperti menggunakan DT[, id := seq_len(.N)\nPemakaian .I[1] contohny digunakan untuk mendapatkan index dimana nilai pertama bagi setiap kumpulan di x. Untuk kumpulan b di kolom x, nilai pertama ialah di barisan 1, nilai pertama bagi kumpulan a di kolom x ialah di barian ke 4 dan nilai pertama kumpulan c di barisan ke 7.\nDT x v y a b 1: b 1 1 1 9 2: b 1 6 2 8 3: b 1 3 3 7 4: a 2 7 4 6 5: a 2 8 5 5 6: a 1 1 6 4 7: c 1 6 7 3 8: c 2 3 8 2 9: c 2 7 9 1 DT[, .I[1], by = x] # first row number in DT corresponding to each group x V1 1: b 1 2: a 4 3: c 7 DT[, .(index = .I[1]), by = x] # Namakan variable untuk index x index 1: 1 1 2: 3 4 3: 7 5 Untuk dapatkan index bagi nilai maksimum mengikut kumpulan di kolom x boleh dibuat seperti cara di bawah.\nDT[, .I[which.max(y)], by = x] # which row number with the max \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; by \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; x V1 1: b 2 2: a 5 3: c 9 .GRP dan rleid Untuk mengkaji menggikut kumpulan secara penyusunan.\nDT[, grp := .GRP, by = x][] # add a group counter x v y a b grp 1: b 1 1 1 9 1 2: b 1 6 2 8 1 3: b 1 3 3 7 1 4: a 2 7 4 6 2 5: a 2 8 5 5 2 6: a 1 1 6 4 2 7: c 1 6 7 3 3 8: c 2 3 8 2 3 9: c 2 7 9 1 3 DT[, .N, by = rleid(v)] # get count of consecutive runs of \u0026#39;v\u0026#39; rleid N 1: 1 3 2: 2 2 3: 3 2 4: 4 2 DT[, c(.(ym = max(y)), lapply(.SD, min)), by = rleid(v), .SDcols = v:b] # compute \u0026#39;j\u0026#39; for each consecutive runs of \u0026#39;v\u0026#39; rleid ym v y a b 1: 1 6 1 1 1 7 2: 2 8 2 7 4 5 3: 3 6 1 1 6 3 4: 4 7 2 3 8 1 Untuk gabungkan dua dataset. Tapi cara ini masih tidak difahami :-(\nX x v foo 1: c 8 4 2: b 7 2 ## need more info for this X[, DT[.BY, y, on = \u0026#34;x\u0026#34;], by = x] # join within each group x V1 1: c 6 2: c 3 3: c 7 4: b 1 5: b 6 6: b 3 Untuk tukar nilai bagi setiap barisan pertama di kumpulan yang sama. Ini biasanya dipakai contohnya bila membuat kajian keluarga dan ingin memberikan kod tertentu yang membezakan keluarga 1 dan 2 dsb.\nCara ini tidak hard code data. Kolom c tidak dimasukkan ke data dan hanya disimpan di memory sahaja. Untuk simpan harus assign to save object atau gunakan cara mult.\n## Recode to 99 for first row in each group by x DT[, {vDT = copy(.SD) #kopi semua kolom vDT[1, c := 99] #buat kolom C row pertama nilai 99 vDT}, by = x] x v y a b grp c 1: b 1 1 1 9 1 99 2: b 1 6 2 8 1 NA 3: b 1 3 3 7 1 NA 4: a 2 7 4 6 2 99 5: a 2 8 5 5 2 NA 6: a 1 1 6 4 2 NA 7: c 1 6 7 3 3 99 8: c 2 3 8 2 3 NA 9: c 2 7 9 1 3 NA DT[unique(x), d:=99, on = \u0026#34;x\u0026#34;, mult = \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;][] Contoh dari manual Ini ialah contoh dan penerangan dari manual sekiranya penerangan diatas tidak difahami.\n## Not run: DT = data.table(x=rep(c(\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;c\u0026#34;),each=3), v=c(1,1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2), y=c(1,3,6), a=1:9, b=9:1) DT X = data.table(x=c(\u0026#34;c\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;), v=8:7, foo=c(4,2)) X DT[.N] # last row, only special symbol allowed in \u0026#39;i\u0026#39; DT[, .N] # total number of rows in DT DT[, .N, by=x] # number of rows in each group DT[, .SD, .SDcols=x:y] # select columns \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; DT[, .SD[1]] # first row of all columns DT[, .SD[1], by=x] # first row of \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;v\u0026#39; for each group in \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; DT[, c(.N, lapply(.SD, sum)), by=x] # get rows *and* sum all columns by group DT[, .I[1], by=x] # row number in DT corresponding to each group starting point DT[, .N, by=rleid(v)] # get count of consecutive runs of \u0026#39;v\u0026#39; DT[, c(.(y=max(y)), lapply(.SD, min)), by=rleid(v), .SDcols=v:b] # compute \u0026#39;j\u0026#39; for each consecutive runs of \u0026#39;v\u0026#39; DT[, grp := .GRP, by=x] # add a group counter X[, DT[.BY, y, on=\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;], by=x] # join within each group ## End(Not run) "

                "body": "Bila memakai pakej data.table untuk membuat fungsi sebagai kode R, pemilihan kolom boleh dibuat dengan menetapkan nama kolom atau indeks kolom. Akan tetapi pemakaian indeks untuk memilih kolom tidak disarankan kerana ia akan mengakibatkan kode susah untuk difahami. Selain itu sekiranya ada kesilapan kode disebabkan indeks yang merujuk kolom yang tidak diingini, mesej amaran tidak akan diberikan. Oleh itu adalah disarankan untuk memakai nama kolom berbanding indeks kolom.\nWalaubagaimanapun, sekiranya masih ingin memakai indeks kolom juga atas sebab-sebab tertentu, terdapat tiga cara yang boleh dipakai. Baca seterusnya untuk dapatkan penerangan.\nNama kolom Untuk memilih kolom berasaskan nama kolom, boleh memakai get untuk satu kolom atau mget untuk memilih pelbagai kolom (multiple get).\nlibrary(data.table) DT = data.table(A = 1:6, B = 8:3, C = 5:10) ## Cara asas DT[B == 4, ] ## Pakai objek var \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;B\u0026#34; value \u0026lt;- 4 DT[get(var) == value, ] ## pilih pelbagai kolom vars \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;) DT[, mget(vars)] #cara mget Sekiranya memakai get untuk memilih pelbagai kolom akan hanya menghasilkan vektor kolom pertama dan bukan data.table kolom A dan B.\nIndeks Untuk memilih hanya satu kolom sahaja, caranya:\nlibrary(data.table) DT = data.table(A = 1:6, B = 8:3, C = 5:10) ## pilih kolom 2 (B) yang nilainya bersamaan 4 DT[.(4), on = names(DT)[2]] #cara 1 DT[DT[[2]] == 4] #cara 2 DT[DT[, .I[.SD == 4], .SDcols = 2]] #cara 3 ## sebagai objek var \u0026lt;- 2 value \u0026lt;- 4 DT[.(value), on = names(DT)[var]] #cara 1 DT[DT[[var]] == value] #cara 2 DT[DT[, .I[.SD == value], .SDcols = var]] #cara 3 ## indeks kolom guna fungsi grep atau which vari \u0026lt;- grep(\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;, colnames(DT)) vari \u0026lt;- which(names(DT) == \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;) #cara ini lebih laju DT[.(4), on = names(DT)[vari]] Hasilnya untuk kode-kode di atas adalah seperti ini:\nA B C 1: 3 4 5 Penggunaan .() di i stuktur data.table DT[i, j, by] adalah alias untuk penggunaan list(). Fungsi ini sama seperti cara 1 di atas.\nDT[list(4), on = names(DT)[2]] Sekiranya ingin pakai index untuk di fungsi by adalah seperti di bawah. Cara ini ialah untuk mengira jumlah huruf-huruf i kolom A.\nDT1 \u0026lt;- data.table(A = letters[1:5], B = rep(1:13)) ## dapatkan index kolom menggunakan \u0026#39;grep\u0026#39; ind \u0026lt;- grep(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, names(DT1)) ## atau menggunakan \u0026#39;which\u0026#39; ind \u0026lt;- which(names(DT1) == \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;) ## note - guna \u0026#39;which\u0026#39; lebih pantas dari \u0026#39;grep\u0026#39; ## jumlah setiap huruf DT1[, .N, by = DT1[[ind]]] Hasilnya\nDT1 N 1: a 3 2: b 3 3: c 3 4: d 2 5: e 2 "
